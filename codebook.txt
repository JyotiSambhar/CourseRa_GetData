Data in tidydata.txt represents data collected from the accelerometers and gyrodcope from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone on group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. There are 88 vaiables for 180 observations.
Each observation represent average of STD and Mean of the features from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals for each subject and each activity.
Raw Data
	 Three sets of entities - subjects, activities, and readings were used to get the tidy data that represents a summary value (mean) of various features.
	 Only the features involving the standard deviation and the mean are used in creating the tidy data.
Brief Description of Data
	SUBJECT - First column in Tidydata (Subject) identifies the volunteer.
	
	ACTIVITY - Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) . Second column in Tidydata represent the activity performed by the Subject.
	
	Rest of the columns are features from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. Refer below information for naming convention used to lable columns.
	
	The time domain signals  vs Frequency Domain signal(prefix 't' to denote time, 'f' indicate frequency domain signals).	
	The acceleration signal is separated inot body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).
	The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
	The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
	A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (note 'f' as prefix to denote frequency domain signal)
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
